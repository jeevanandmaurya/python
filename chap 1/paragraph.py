      Python language is widely used in Machine Learning because it provides libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
      These libraries offer tools and functions essential for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models.
      It is well-known for its readability and offers platform independence. 
      These all things make it the perfect language of choice for Machine Learning.

      Machine Learning is a subdomain of artificial intelligence. 
      It allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed,
      and It is designed in such a way that allows systems to identify patterns, make predictions, and make decisions based on data.''')
